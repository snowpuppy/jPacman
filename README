Welcome to jPacman

== Game Description ==
This game is based on the popular Pacman game.
The objective of the game is to make all of
the yellow dots dissapear.

When the main character wins/loses, you must
click the 'x' in the upper right hand
corner of the window to quit and re-run
the program to go again. I know it's lame,
but it's simple. I might add a try-again
feature later.

GHOSTS:
There are four ghosts:
* pink
* blue
* orange
* red

The pink, orange, and red ghosts move
according to a DFS algorithm. Each ghost
prefers a different order of directions
in the set (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).

A BFS movement algorithm was written
to support having a ghost find the
shortest path to chase pacman, but
it isn't being used. You can enable
it experimentally if you want. It
makes the game a lot less playable
because you have one ghost that's
always on your tail.

MAIN CHARACTER:
There is one yellow character, which
the player can control. The yellow
character does an eating animation.

DOTS:
There are 157 dots in the game.
When the main character comes
in contact with the yellow dots,
they dissapear.

CONTROLS:
The arrow keys move the main
character.
When the game ends, click the
'x' in the window to quit the
program.
Not much else to say.
